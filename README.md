# Machine Learning (Coursera)

This is all the digital material I collected throughout the course (other than a notebook filled with stuff which I clearly can't share...Yet!).

__PLEASE do not just copy the solutions to the assignments, don't even look at them if your purpose is to solve them yourself. If you do so you are an imbecile! There is no point in taking an online course to learn and cheat your way through. Do yourself a favor and spend your time on something else.__ (Oh and you are also violating Coursera's policies).

Any correction/optimization/advice is well accepted.
